# SOLVE THE PUZZLE ðŸ§©

## About

The Simpson's Puzzle is a game made with the intention of distracting and helping the brain solve the problem while Homer tries to eat his donut.

--------------------
## Design

The choice of simple design was made because I didn't want to create a big contrast between the background and the game and I decided to choose to leave only the official colors of The Simpsons design.

### Color Scheme:

The palette was defined trough search on the [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en) 

### Typography: 

I used the already available and standard fonts like Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif.
